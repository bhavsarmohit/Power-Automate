Step-by-Step Guide to Create the Flow
Log in to Power Automate:
Go to the Power Automate portal and log in with your Microsoft account.

Create a New Flow:

Click on "Create" in the left-hand navigation pane.
Choose "Automated cloud flow."
Set the Trigger:

In the "Build an automated flow" window, search for "Outlook."
Select "When a new email arrives (V3)" from the triggers.
Click "Create."
Configure the Trigger:

Set the parameters as needed (e.g., specify the folder, include subfolders, etc.).
Configure any conditions (e.g., from specific senders, subject contains certain words, etc.).
Initialize Variables:

Click on "New step."
Search for "Initialize variable" and select it.
Set the variable name to EmailBody and type to String. Leave the value blank.
Add another "Initialize variable" step, set the name to URLs and type to Array, and leave the value blank.
Get Email Body:

Click on "New step."
Search for "Compose" and select it.
In the "Inputs" field, add Body from the "When a new email arrives (V3)" trigger.
Set Email Body Variable:

Click on "New step."
Search for "Set variable" and select it.
Set the name to EmailBody and the value to the output of the "Compose" step.
Extract URLs Using Regular Expression:

Click on "New step."
Search for "Compose" and select it.
In the "Inputs" field, add the following expression to extract URLs using regex:
expression
Copy code
{
    "expression": "split(variables('EmailBody'), ' ')",
    "inputs": "compose"
}
Filter Out Non-URLs:

Click on "New step."
Search for "Filter array" and select it.
Set the "From" field to the output of the previous "Compose" step.
In the condition, use the following expression:
Field: item()
Condition: matches
Value: ^((http|https):\/\/)?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}(/[\w]*)*\/?$
Append URLs to Array Variable:

Click on "New step."
Search for "Append to array variable" and select it.
Set the name to URLs.
Set the value to the output of the "Filter array" step.
Send Email with Extracted URLs (Optional):

Click on "New step."
Search for "Send an email (V2)" and select it.
Configure the email parameters (To, Subject, Body).
In the body, include the URLs variable:
html
Copy code
<p>Extracted URLs:</p>
<p>@{join(variables('URLs'), '<br>')}</p>
Save and Test the Flow:

Click on "Save."
Test the flow by sending an email that contains URLs to the configured inbox.
Example Flow JSON
Here is an example JSON for the flow for easier import:

                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "AppendToArrayVariable",
            "inputs": {
                "name": "URLs",
                "value": "@outputs('FilterArray')"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "SendEmail",
            "inputs": {
                "To": "your-email@example.com",
                "Subject": "Extracted URLs",
                "Body": "<p>Extracted URLs:</p><p>@{join(variables('URLs'), '<br>')}</p>"
            }
        }
    ]
}
This flow will automatically extract URLs from incoming emails and send the list of URLs to a specified email address. Make sure to adjust the "Send email" step with your own email details.




substring(variables('EmailBody'), add(indexOf(variables('EmailBody'), '<a href="'), length('<a href="')), sub(indexOf(variables('EmailBody'), '" title="Own">Own</a>'), add(indexOf(variables('EmailBody'), '<a href="'), length('<a href="'))))




substring(variables('EmailBody'), add(lastIndexOf(variables('EmailBody'), 'Own') + length('Own'), 1), indexOf(substring(variables('EmailBody'), lastIndexOf(variables('EmailBody'), 'Own')), 'a href="'))
